The process for dispatching goods at a computer hardware shop begins when goods need to be shipped. A parallel gateway splits the process into two concurrent paths: one handled by the Secretary and the other by the Warehouse. 

In the Secretary's lane, the first task is to clarify the shipment method. An exclusive gateway determines if special handling is required based on the quantity (large amounts need special shipping, small amounts use normal post). For special shipping, the Secretary invites three logistic companies to submit offers and selects one. For normal post, the Secretary writes a package label. Additionally, an inclusive gateway allows for optional parcel insurance by the logistics department head if necessary, which runs parallel to label writing. Both paths (special shipping and normal post) converge at another inclusive gateway before moving to an exclusive gateway.

In the Warehouse lane, goods are packaged by warehousemen concurrently with the Secretary's tasks. The Warehouse's packaging process directly feeds into an exclusive gateway that waits for the Secretary's process to complete. Once both paths converge at the final exclusive gateway, the packaged goods are prepared for pickup by the logistic company, ending the process with "Shipment prepared." The process ensures parallel execution of shipment method clarification and packaging, with conditional steps for special shipping and optional insurance.
