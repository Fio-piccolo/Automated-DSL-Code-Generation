The process involves three participants: Guest food consumption, Employee order processing, and Chef meal preparation. When a guest notices hunger, they enter the restaurant, choose a dish, and wait for their turn. They then place an order, pay money, and take a buzzer. The employee receives the order, enters it into the POS system, collects payment, sets up the buzzer, and informs the chef. The chef prepares the meal, places it in the hatch, and notifies the employee that the meal is ready. The employee sets off the buzzer when the meal is ready. The guest waits for the buzzer signal, then gets the meal and eats it, ending the process when no longer hungry. If the guest does not appear after the buzzer is set off, the employee waits for 5 minutes and then calls the guest, repeating until the guest appears to hand over the meal. Message flows connect order placement, payment confirmation, buzzer handover, chef notifications, and meal readiness signals between participants.
