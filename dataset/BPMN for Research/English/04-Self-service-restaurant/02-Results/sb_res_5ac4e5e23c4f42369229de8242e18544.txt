The business process described in the BPMN diagram outlines the steps involved in a guest dining experience at a restaurant, involving three main participants: the Guest, the Employee, and the Chef. Here is a natural language description of the business logic:

2. **Enter the Restaurant:** The guest enters the restaurant.
3. **Choose Dish:** The guest selects a dish from the menu.
4. **Place Order:** The guest places their order.
5. **Pay the Order:** The guest pays for their meal.
6. **Wait Until Buzzer Rings:** The guest waits until a buzzer rings, indicating their meal is ready.
7. **Pick Up the Meal:** Upon hearing the buzzer, the guest picks up their meal.
8. **Eat the Meal:** The guest eats the meal.
9. **Hunger Satisfied:** The process ends when the guest's hunger is satisfied.

**Employee's Role:**

1. **Receive Order:** An employee receives the guest's order.
2. **Enter Order into System:** The employee enters the order into the system.
3. **Collect Money:** The employee collects payment from the guest.

5. **The Order Finished and Placed in the Hatch:** Once the meal is ready, the employee places it in the service hatch.

**Chef's Responsibilities:**

1. **Order New Meal:** The chef receives a new meal order.
2. **Prepare the Meal:** The chef prepares the meal according to the order.
