The business process described in the BPMN diagram involves three main participants: Guest, Employee, and Chef. The process outlines the steps taken when a guest feels hungry, places an order, and eventually receives their meal. Here's the natural language description of the process:

1. **Guest's Process:**
   - The process starts when the guest feels hungry.
   - The guest chooses a dish from the menu.
   - The guest waits for their turn.
   - Once it's their turn, the guest places the order.
   - The guest waits for the order to be ready.
   - Once the order is ready, the guest picks up the meal.
   - The guest eats the meal.
   - The process ends when the guest's hunger is satisfied.

2. **Employee's Process:**
   - When a new order is received, the employee enters the order into the POS system.
   - The employee then receives the money from the guest.
   - The employee gives the customer a buzzer.
   - The employee sends the order to the Chef.
   - The employee waits for the order to be ready.
   - Once the order is ready, the employee sets off the guest's buzzer.
   - If the guest picks up the meal within 5 minutes, the order is completed. If not, the process continues to wait.

3. **Chef's Process:**
   - When a new order is received, the Chef prepares the meal.
   - Once the meal is prepared, it is placed in the service hatch.
   - The Chef then notifies that the order is ready.
   - The process ends once the order is complete.

This process ensures that the guest's order is efficiently managed from the moment they feel hungry until they are satisfied after eating their meal.
