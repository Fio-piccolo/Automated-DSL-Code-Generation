The business process described in the BPMN diagram can be outlined in natural language as follows:

1. **Initiation**: The process begins with the need to send goods ("Ware soll versendet werden").

2. **Decision on Special Delivery**: The first decision point checks if special delivery is required ("Ist Sonderversand nötig?").

   - **Yes**: The process proceeds to request quotations ("Angebote einholen"), select the cheapest offer ("günstigstes Angebot auswählen"), and engage a freight forwarder ("Spediteur beauftragen").
   
   - **No**: The process skips to filling out the standardized consignment note ("standardisierten Paketschein ausfüllen").

3. **Insurance Check**: After engaging the freight forwarder, another decision point checks if insurance is needed ("Ist eine Versicherung nötig?").

   - **Yes**: The process includes concluding the insurance ("Versicherung abschließen").

4. **Final Preparations**: Regardless of the insurance decision, the goods are packed ("Ware verpacken") and prepared for pickup ("Ware zur Abholung bereitstellen").

5. **Completion**: The process concludes with the goods being delivered ("Ware bereitgestellt").

This structured flow ensures that all necessary steps, including decisions on special delivery and insurance, are addressed to successfully deliver the goods.
