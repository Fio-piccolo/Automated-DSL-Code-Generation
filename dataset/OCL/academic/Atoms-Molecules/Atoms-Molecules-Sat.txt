The requirements are as follows:

1. Each instance of the Atom class must have a weight that is greater than zero. This requirement ensures that atoms cannot have a negative or zero atomic weight.
2. The weight of an Atom must be unique in all instances of Atom. This implies an atom cannot share the same atomic weight with another atom.
3. For every instance of the Molecule class, none of the particles (which are assumed to be instances of the Atom) can be a noble gas. This implies all instances of Molecule must not consist of noble gases.
