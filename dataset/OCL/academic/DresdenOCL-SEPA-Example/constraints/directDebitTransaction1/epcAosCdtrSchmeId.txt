The requirements are as follows:

In the context of DirectDebitTransaction1, ensure that the creditor's schema ID (cdtrSchmeId) is either undefined or it is defined in such a way that the size of its name (nm), postal address (pstlAdr), organization ID (orgId), and country of residence (ctryOfRes) are all equal to 0. This requirement is based on the fact that the elements Nm, PstlAdr, Id OrgId, and CtryOfRes in DrctDbtTx CdtrSchmeId are only for AOS (Advanced Ordering System) community members. Instructed banks that are not in the AOS community may reject messages containing these elements. This requirement is in line with section 1.2 of the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) B2B (Business-to-Business) Direct Debit C2B (Customer-to-Business) Implementation Guidelines.
