The requirements are as follows: In the context of DirectDebitTransactionInformation1, it must be ensured that there are no elements present within the collections 'rgltryRptg', 'tax' and 'rltdRmtInf'. This is highlighted with the stipulation that the size of each of these collections must be zero. This requirement comes with a warning that, for instructed banks not in the AOS community, messages with these elements may be rejected. It should be noted that this requirement refers to the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines.
