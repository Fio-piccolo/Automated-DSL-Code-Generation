The requirements are as follows: In the context of "DirectDebitTransactionInformation1" within the "isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101" package, it is stated that the size of 'pmtTpInf' should be 0. This indicates there should not be any payment type information included in a Direct Debit Transaction Information. A warning is also given indicating that the element PmtTpInf in DrctDbtTxInf is for AOS only and any instructed banks that are not in the AOS community may reject messages containing these elements. This follows the section 1.2 of the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines.
