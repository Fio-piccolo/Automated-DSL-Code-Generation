The requirements are as follows: In the context of Direct Debit Transaction Information, there are checks for ultimate creditor's postal address and country of residence. One condition is that the ultimate creditor field itself may not be defined at all. Alternatively, if it is defined, neither the postal address nor the country of residence of the ultimate creditor should be populated. It should be noted that these elements are only for AOS community, and instructed banks that are not part of this community may reject messages containing these elements. This requirement is based on section 1.2 of the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines.
