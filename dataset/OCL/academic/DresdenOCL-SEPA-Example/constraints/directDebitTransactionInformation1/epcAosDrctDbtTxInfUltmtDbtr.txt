The requirement is as follows: In the context of DirectDebitTransactionInformation1, it is critical to ensure a particular condition concerning the ultimate debtor (ultmtDbtr). The rule is that the ultmtDbtr should either be undefined, or both the postal address (pstlAdr) and the country of residence (ctryOfRes) of the ultmtDbtr should not contain any elements. Please note that the elements PstlAdr and CtryOfRes are exclusively for the AOS community. Non-AOS member banks might reject messages that include these elements. Refer to section 1.2 of the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines for additional details.
