The requirement is as follows:

This requirement is about a software package named "isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101". Within this package, the object DirectDebitTransactionInformation1 has an operation or instruction set for the creditor agent (InstrForCdtrAgt).

There is an important note that 'InstrForCdtrAgt' in the DirectDebitTransactionInformation1 is only for 'AOS' community, and non-'AOS' community banks who are instructed may reject messages containing these elements. Further specifications are referred to section 1.2 of the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines.

The key operation to note here is 'EPC_AOS_InstrForCdtrAgt': The 'instrForCdtrAgt' should have a size of 0. This essentially means that no instructions should be currently set for the creditor agent.
