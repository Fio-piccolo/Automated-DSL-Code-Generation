The requirement is as follows: In the context of Direct Debit Transaction Information (DirectDebitTransactionInformation1), it is recommended that Charge Bearer (chrgBr) should not be specified as part of Direct Debit Transaction Information (DrctDbTxInf). Instead, it should be specified as part of Payment Information (PmtInf). This is according to row 10 of section 2.1.3 of Payment Information on page 9 of the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines document. In other words, the size of Charge Bearer (chrgBr) in Direct Debit Transaction Information should be zero.
