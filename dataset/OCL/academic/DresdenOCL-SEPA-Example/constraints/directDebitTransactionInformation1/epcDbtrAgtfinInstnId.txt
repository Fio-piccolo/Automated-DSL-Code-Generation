The requirement is as follows: 
In the Direct Debit Transaction Information (DirectDebitTransactionInformation1), for the Debtor's Agent (dbtrAgt finInstnId), only the Business Identifier Code (BIC) is allowed whereas the Clearing System Member Id (clrSysMmbId), name and address (nmAndAdr), proprietary id (prtryId), combined id (cmbndId), and the branch id (brnchId) should not exist (i.e., their count is zero). This rule is in accordance with the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines Version 1.3 (referencing row 14 on page 12).
