The requirement is as follows:

Within the package 'isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101' for the context 'DirectDebitTransactionInformation1', a constraint, 'EPC_DbtradrLine', is defined for 'dbtr.pstlAdr.adrLine', corresponding to debtor's postal address lines in a direct debit transaction. The logic states that if there exists at least one occurrence of the debtor's address line, then the maximum size of debtor's address lines allowed should be limited to two. In other words, the debtor's postal address can have a maximum of two address lines in a direct debit transaction. This is as per the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines Version 1.3, referenced on row 3, page 13.
