The requirement is as follows:

In the context of Direct Debit Transaction Information model, a rule stipulates that the Debtor Identification (represented as 'dbtr.id.orgId') should only contain one of the following nine sub-elements: BIC, IBEI, BEI, EANGLN, USCHU, DUNS, BkPryId, TaxIdNb, or prtryId. This is dictated as such that the size of the combined sub-elements cannot be greater than one when the original parent element 'dbtr.id.orgId' size equals one. This requirement is in line with the rules set in the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines Version 1.3, particularly referring to the instructions found on row 11 on page 13.
