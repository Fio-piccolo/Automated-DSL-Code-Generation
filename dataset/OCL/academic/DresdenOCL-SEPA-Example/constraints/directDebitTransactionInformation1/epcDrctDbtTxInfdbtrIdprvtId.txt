The requirements are as follows: For the Direct Debit Transaction Information-Debtor (represented by the class DirectDebitTransactionInformation1) in the package isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101 based on the model pain.008.001.01corrected.xsd, the debtor's Private Identification (represented by dbtr.id.prvtId) should appear no more than once. This implies that the debtor's private identification may not exist (i.e., it can be undefined), or if it does exist, there should only be no more than one instance of it. This rule aligns with the row 12 on page 13 of SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines Version 1.3.
