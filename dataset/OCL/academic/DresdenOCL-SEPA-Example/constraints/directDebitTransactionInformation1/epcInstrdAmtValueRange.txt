The requirement is as follows: In the context of Direct Debit Transaction Information1, the instructed amount (instdAmt) in the direct debit transaction information has to be between 0.01 at minimum and 999999999.99 at maximum, inclusive. This is validated by the OCL constraint EPC_InstrdAmtValueRange. This requirement is aligned with the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines, particularly as outlined in row 18 on page 9.
