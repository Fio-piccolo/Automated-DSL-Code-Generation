The requirements are as follows: 

In the package 'isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101', particularly in the context of 'GroupHeader1', there are few constraints that needs to be followed. These fields namely, 'Authstn', 'FwdgAgt', 'InitgPty PstlAdr' and 'InitgPty CtryOfRes' should not be filled if the instructed banks are not in the AOS community as these are only applicable for AOS (Aspect Oriented Software). If these fields are filled, then the non-AOS community banks may reject these messages. Hence, the size of these fields should be zero as defined in the constraint 'EPC_AOS_GrpHdr'. This is in reference to section 1.2 of the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines.
