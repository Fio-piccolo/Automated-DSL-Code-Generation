The requirements are as follows: 

Within the context of GroupHeader1 in the package isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101, which is referencing the model pain.008.001.01corrected.xsd, there is an invariant EPC_GrpHdrGrpgMIXD. This invariant requires that the value of 'grpg' must always be set to 'MIXD'. This requirement is based on the fact that according to the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines Version 1.3, 'grpg' can only be set to 'MIXD' within the GroupHeader.
