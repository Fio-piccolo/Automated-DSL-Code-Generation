The requirement is as follows: 

For the `GroupHeader1` context in the `isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101` package, the organisation identification (`InitgPty Id orgId`) should contain only one of the following subelements: BIC, IBEI, BEI, EANGLN, USCHU, DUNS, BkPryId, TaxIdNb, or prtryId. If the size of `initgPty.id.orgId` equals 1, this implies that the total size of all these subelements should be less or equal to 1. This rule is stated in the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines Version 1.3, on page 7, row 1.
