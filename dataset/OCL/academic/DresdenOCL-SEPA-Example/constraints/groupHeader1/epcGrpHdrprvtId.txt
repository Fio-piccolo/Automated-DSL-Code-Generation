The requirement is as follows: In the context of "GroupHeader1" located in the "isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101" package, the private identification "initgPty Id prvtId" can only occur once at most. That is, if the identifier "initgPty.id" is defined or instantiated, the size of the private identification "prvtId" should be less than or equal to 1. It is not allowed to have more than one instance of private identification. This is based on reference row 2 on page 7 of SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines Version 1.3.
