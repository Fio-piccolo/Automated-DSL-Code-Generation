The requirement is as follows: 

In the context of the package named 'isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101', within the class 'MandateRelatedInformation1' there is a requirement to ensure that the collections 'frstColltnDt', 'fnlColltnDt' and 'frqcy', representing the first collection date, final collection date, and frequency, respectively, must not have any elements in them, or in other words, their size should be zero. This is a constraint specific to a community named AOS. Banks that are not part of the AOS community may reject messages containing these elements. Reference can be found in section 1.2 of the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines.
