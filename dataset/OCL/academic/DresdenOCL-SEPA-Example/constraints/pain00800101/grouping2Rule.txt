The requirements are as follows:

Assuming the presence of a model known as 'pain.008.001.01corrected.xsd', under the package 'isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101' it is stipulated that if a GroupHeader/Grouping exists and is marked as 'SNGL', then every instance of 'PaymentInformation' must have one and only one occurrence of PaymentInformation/DirectDebitTransactionInformation. This requirement can be found in page 79 of Payments_Standards-Initiation_updated.pdf. Specifically, in the context of the 'Pain00800101' model, should the grouping within the group header equal 'SNGL', then all instances of 'PaymentInformation', identified as 'a', should have the 'DirectDebitTransactionInformation' size equalling one.
