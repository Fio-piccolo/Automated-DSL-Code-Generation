The requirements are as follows: In the context of the PaymentInstructionInformation2 class within the isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101 package, an invariant rule is established, named 'ChargesAccountAgentRule'. This rule sets up constraints on the ChargesAccountAgent attribute. The implication of the rule states that, if the size of the ChargesAccountAgent equals to one, then certain conditions must be satisfied.

These conditions involve assessing the correspondence between the ChargesAccountAgent and the CreditorAgent. Specifically, the size of the branch ID of the CreditorAgent should also equal to one. Furthermore, the Clearing System Member Identification, the Combined ID, the Name and Address, the Proprietary ID, and the BIC (Bank Identifier Code) of the Financial Institution Identification under ChargesAccountAgent should all match their corresponding attributes under CreditorAgent.

The intent of these rules is to ensure that the ChargesAccountAgent and the CreditorAgent originate from the same financial institution and there is not a completely different financial institution involved. These requirements are based on the financial standards document Payments_Standards-Initiation_updated.pdf reference on page 86.
