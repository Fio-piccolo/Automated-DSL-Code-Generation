The requirement is as follows: In the context of PaymentInstructionInformation2 in the package ISOStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101, there should be no charges account agent (ChrgsAcctAgt) present. This is due to a warning that only those in the AOS community can have ChrgsAcctAgt within their payment information. Instructed banks that are not part of the AOS community might reject messages containing these elements. Please refer to section 1.2 of the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines for more information.
