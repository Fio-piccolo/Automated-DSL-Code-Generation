The requirements are as follows:

Within the package isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101, there is a context 'PaymentInstructionInformation2'. An invariant 'EPC_AOS_UltmtCdtr' is defined within this context. This invariant checks whether the 'ultmtCdtr' attribute is undefined or not. If defined, then it checks the size of 'pstlAdr' and 'ctryOfRes' attributes of 'ultmtCdtr'. The size of both these attributes should be 0. In this way, the code ensures that if 'ultmtCdtr' - the ultimate creditor is defined, then it must not have values for postal address ('pstlAdr') or country of residence ('ctryOfRes").
