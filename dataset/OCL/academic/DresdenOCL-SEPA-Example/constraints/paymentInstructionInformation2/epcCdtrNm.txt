The requirement is as follows: In the context of PaymentInstructionInformation2 in the package isoStdIso20022TechXsdPain00800101, the Creditor Name (represented by the parameter 'cdtr.nm') must not be empty. This is stipulated as a mandatory condition in the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines (row 5 on page 8). It is enforced by the OCL constraint 'cdtr.nm->size() > 0', which ensures that the size of the 'cdtr.nm' parameter is greater than zero.
