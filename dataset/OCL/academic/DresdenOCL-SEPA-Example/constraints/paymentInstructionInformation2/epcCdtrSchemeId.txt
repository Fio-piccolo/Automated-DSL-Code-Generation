The requirement is as follows: within a 'Payment Instruction Information 2' object, it is recommended that all transactions within the same 'Payment Information' block have the same 'Creditor Scheme Identification'. This is only checking the 'Other ID' within the 'Private ID' as it is the only identification that can be utilized in 'pacs3'. In case if this is not enough, 'EPC_cdtrSchmeId_UNUSED_FULL' rule can be enabled. This rule applies to each pair (a, b) of 'Creditor Scheme Identification' within the 'Direct Debit Transaction Info'. If a or b is undefined, the rule is satisfied. If both are defined, they both must have the same 'Other ID' and 'ID Type' within a 'Private ID'. This rule references page 11, row 14 of the SEPA C2B Implementation Guidelines.
