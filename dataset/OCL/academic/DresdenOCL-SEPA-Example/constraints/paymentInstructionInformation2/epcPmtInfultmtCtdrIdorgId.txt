The requirement is as follows:
In the context of Payment Instruction Information (PaymentInstructionInformation2), there is a constraint (EPC_PmtInfultmtCdtrIdorgId) on the Payment Information Ultimate Creditor Organisation Identification (PmtInf ultmtCdtr Id orgId). This identification can only contain one of the subelements such as BIC, IBEI, BEI, EANGLN, USCHU, DUNS, BkPryId, TaxIdNb, or prtryId. In other words, the sum of the sizes of all these subelements should be less than or equal to one. This requirement is aligned with the rule stated in line 7 on page 9 of the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines Version 1.3.
