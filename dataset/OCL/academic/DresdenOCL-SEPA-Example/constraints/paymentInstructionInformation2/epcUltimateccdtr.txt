The requirements are as follows: In the context of "PaymentInstructionInformation2", if the size of "ultmtCdtr", namely the ultimate creditor field in the Payment Information, is greater than 0, it means this field is populated, thus it should not be included in the Direct Debit Transaction Information. Consequently, every 'drctDbtTxInf' - which stands for Direct Debit Transaction Information, must have an 'ultmtCdtr', ultimate creditor field, size of 0, meaning it should not be populated.
