The requirement is as follows: The Local Instrument field (PmtInf PmtTpInf LclInstrm) in the context of Payment Type Information 2 (PaymentTypeInformation2) is mandatory. This is enforced by the constraint that the size of the Local Instrument (lclInstrm) set must be greater than zero. This complies with the SEPA B2B Direct Debit C2B Implementation Guidelines Version 1.3, specifically row 9, section 2.1.3 on page 7.
