The requirements are as follows:

1. For an object of the AbWorld type, there must be exactly one predecessor world (PredWorld) and one successor world (SuccWorld) existing.

2. There should be at most one Initial World instance in the system at any point, i.e. the number of instances of the AbInitWorld class should be less than 2.

3. An object of the AbEndWorld type should have exactly one predecessor world (PredWorld) and no successor world should exist.

4. A Coin must belong to a Purse. This is defined in each World object, there would be at least one purse existing that includes the coin either in its balance or its lost coins.

5. Regarding the balance and lost coins in a Purse, there should not be any coin sharing between two different purses in two distinct worlds. It means that if two purses are different, their corresponding worlds should also be different.
